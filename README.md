# Ardm-property

ActiveRecord plugin to provide a smooth migration from DataMapper to ActiveRecord.

This is an adaptation of the original DataMapper source code to allow
users of the now defunct DataMapper to ActiveRecord. Much of this code
was originally written by Sam Smoot and Dan Kubb as
[dm-types](https://github.com/datamapper/dm-types) and
[dm-core](https://github.com/datamapper/dm-core). See LICENSE for details.
